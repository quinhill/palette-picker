## About Palette Picker

Palette Picker is an app designed to create color palettes for a project. 
Functionality includes:

* Generating entire palettes 
* Locking individual colors and generating new ones around them
* Saving a projet name
* Saving palettes to those projects 

## Goals

The main goal of this project was to learn Node.js and code out a backend. I created Palette Picker as a student at the Turing School of Software and Design. The Challenge was in the time frame of the project, which was one week.

This app is deployed on Heroku.
